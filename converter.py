# This code takes in the pathname of a csv file then takes in the CSV, adds \n to the end
# of a row and then takes all of these items and puts them into one joined string storing
# them into a new csv called "finalfile.csv".
# The csv package is necessary for this function to operate successfully.
# PLEASE NOTE THAT THE INPUT CSV CANNOT HAVE COMMAS WITHIN THE TITLES FOR ITEMS OR IT WILL BREAK
